Metagenomic Source Location Predictive Model

This respository contains the codes used to create and evaluate a predictive model of the source location (e.g. freshwater, marine water, human, animal, etc.) of metagenomic data based on the random forest algorthim. These metagenomes can be either RNAseq or shotgun DNAseq, but not amplicon/16s rRNA seq.

For a step by step protocol of how to re-create this model see the document titled protocol.pdf.

For a detailed explaination of the algorithm and the reasoning behind the use of this particular method, see the document "thesis_final_version.docx." This document also contains the expected output of the graphs from all of included R scripts.
